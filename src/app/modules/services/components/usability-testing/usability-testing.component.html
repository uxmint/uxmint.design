                      <p>A controlled environment testing session is moderated in person or remotely by a trained researcher; who walks through the tasks to participants, answers their queries, and asks follow-up questions. Conversely, an uncontrolled test is done without direct supervision; participants might be in a lab, but it's more likely they are in their own homes and/or using their own devices to browse the website that is being tested. But they can also be unobtrusively monitored by the researcher.</p>

The aim of the testing is mostly to uncover maximum usability issues with minimal time. This type of testing typically can be done in the early stages of product development and helps researchers pinpoint gaps in the market, identify potential new features, and workshop new ideas.</p>

This method suits when an existing application needs revamp or enhancement to collect maximum possible data for the existing users.</p>
